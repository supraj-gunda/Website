          <p>This was 11th grade, in the middle of January. The construction company was digging up the pipes at the street corner. There was no drinkable water so Dad got a couple of huge water-cooler jugs of water. I think this might have happened while we were moving, because I remember going through the street from our old house to the bus stop. I remember I had to put down the jugs every 20 seconds because they were that heavy and awkward to carry. Keep in mind, it was bitter cold.</p>
<p>Once we got back to the house, I went upstairs and wrapped myself up in bed. It was so cozy and warm. But I was texting someone. And my hands had to be outside the blanket in order to text. This completely froze my hands. Yet, I bore through it and continued texting. Eventually, I got some of the best or worst news I'd ever gotten. I don't remember the exact timeline any more, but it was definitely earth-shattering. My face and chest got very hot. </p>
<p>It was a very odd night of hot and cold.</p>        </div>

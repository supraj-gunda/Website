          <p>I'm not sure if this is a real memory. It might be a memory. It might be a dream. It might be something inspired by the truth. Or it might have been inspired from the truth, but has been altered by my mind over the years. Or maybe it's completely fabricated. Not sure.</p>
<p>My grandma is standing in front of her apartment, watering her flowers. All I "remember" about the apartment is that it was gray. There was a story about a monkey in the apartment once. There was also a beehive. I was watching her from the elementary school across the street. I was watching through the bar gate. I think I said "hi!" to her. I think she didn't hear me, but she would've told me to go back to class anyways.</p>
<p>I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom and snuck off to stand by the gate.</p>        </div>

          <p>This is another fuzzy memory. I can't tell if this was a real memory from my time in elementary school, or my mind fabricated this memory after the fact. Another possibility is that we went down this bus path for a middle school/high school trip and then I was finally able to remember elementary school memories.</p>
<p>I still can't tell you the exact location of this place but I think I know the general direction. There was a big hill before a bridge. This was a bus stop but I don't think I knew anyone who got on/off here. The grass was really greener here. It was usually sunny, or at the worst, overcast. I think there was a pond. I'm almost sure there were a bunch of rich people houses, which makes sense given the direction I think this place was in. There was so much free grassy field, almost like a pasture. There were long footpaths that stretched from the bus stop to the individual houses. Many of the famous early 2000s songs would play when we were at this bus stop (I always remember this being like a 5-minute stop, because I think Ms. Indira had to make sure everyone's parents were at the stop or something). The most memorable song though was "One Last Time" by Ariana Grande, which I only discovered the name of and artist about 10 years later.</p>        </div>

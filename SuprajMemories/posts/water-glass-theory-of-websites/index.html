          <p>Junior year of high school was rough. Looking back, I don't understand how I possibly got through it. The social scene, the academic load, everything seemed to be turning against me. The 4 hours-of-sleep-a-day schedule would kill me if I had to do it nowadays. No person should ever have to live like that. It helps me realize now that it never really was that serious.</p>
<p>I would come home at 2:30. Eat a snack or goof off or relax until 3:30. Then it was sit on my bed and do chemistry, calculus, or whatever other work. Mainly chemistry. I think I was so tired from the lack of sleep, that I would usually take an accidental hour long nap every day sometime during 4-6. It would be sitting in the same spot and doing work until the sun set. And all of a sudden, dad would open the door and tell me to come downstairs.</p>
<p>This sounds quite depressing, and it partially was. But I still remember the beautiful colors coming from my bedside window during sunset. Orange, pink, yellow, and even purple.</p>        </div>
